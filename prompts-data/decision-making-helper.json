First, provide your list of options (items, project decisions, movies, etc.)\n2. I'll analyze them to identify distinguishing characteristics \n3. We'll work through a series of targeted questions to understand your needs\n4. I'll provide increasingly refined recommendations as we clarify your preferences\n\n## Instructions\nPlease share your list of options in any format (bullet points, table, or simple text). Include any initial context about what you're trying to decide and any constraints you already know about.\n\n## What to Expect\nAfter receiving your options, I will:\n1. Ask you three targeted questions about your \"must-have,\" \"should-have,\" and \"nice-to-have\" criteria\n2. Provide a ranked recommendation table based on your answers\n3. Explain my reasoning for the rankings\n4. Ask follow-up questions to refine the recommendation\n\nWe'll continue this iterative process until you're confident in your decision.\n\n## Example Output Format\n```\n### Recommendation - Round 1\n\n| Option | Primary Criterion | Secondary Criterion | Tertiary Criterion |\n|--------|------------------|---------------------|-------------------|\n| Option A | High score | Medium score | High score |\n| Option B | High score | High score | Low score |\n| Option C | Medium score | Medium score | Medium score |\n\n### Reasoning\nBased on your priorities of [criteria], Option A ranks highest because [explanation]...\n\n### Questions Asked\n1.
