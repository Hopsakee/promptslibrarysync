      "content": "I'm about to read the given document.\n\nTask: Judge the likely quality and my likely ROI from reading it, given my interests and current knowledge.\n\nAssume I value:\n- Enduring ideas, mental models, and clear conceptual distinctions.\n- Strong arguments, synthesis, and well-supported claims.\n- References/citations when they are integrated and guide further study.\n- Actionable steps are nice-to-have, not required.\n\nFollow these steps:\n\n## Step 0 — Assumed Reader Baseline (no “personal fit”)\nAssume the reader is already beyond beginner level in the document’s domain.\n- Not “how to start in an hour.”\n- Knows fundamentals and common vocabulary.\n- Wants depth, conceptual clarity, and well-supported claims.\n\n## Step 1 — Classify the Document (1 label)\nChoose exactly one:\nA) How-to / tutorial\nB) Research / technical report\nC) Philosophy / theology / humanities essay (argumentative)\nD) History / narrative (story-driven)\nE) Reference / survey / literature review\nF) Marketing / announcement / demo\n\nWrite 1 sentence explaining why you chose it.\n\n## Step 2 — Extract “Instances of Value” (IVs)\nExtract ONLY items that would meaningfully change an informed reader’s understanding.\nAn IV can be ANY of the following:\n1) A new mental model / framing that compresses complexity.\n2) A precise definition or distinction that resolves confusion (conceptual clarity).\n3) A strong argument move: premises → inference → conclusion (including counterarguments).\n4) A synthesis that connects domains (bridges ideas that are rarely bridged well).\n5) A high-quality “reading map”: references that are curated + contextualized (why each matters).\n6) A concrete method/practice/heuristic (optional category, not required).\n7) A historically influential or canonical position explained in a way that reveals why it mattered.\n\nIMPORTANT:\n- “Mentions” do NOT count. The document must do explanatory work: justify, argue, define, or synthesize.\n- You may include 0 IVs if the document is shallow or purely promotional.\n\n## Step 3 — Score EACH IV (0–3) with strict rubric\nFor every IV, assign points:\n\nDepth (0–3):\n0 = mere assertion / slogan\n1 = some explanation but thin\n2 = clear reasoning or concrete example\n3 = deep, layered reasoning OR uniquely clarifying synthesis\n\nPlus 1 bonus point (optional, +0 or +1) IF the IV is unusually enduring (likely valuable in 5–10 years).\n\nIV Score = Depth (0–3) + Endurance Bonus (0–1). Max per IV = 4.\n\n## Step 4 — Score Document Quality (Intrinsic) and ROI (separate)\nCompute two separate scores:\n\nA) Intrinsic Quality Score (0–20), sum of:\n- Argument/Rigor (0–5): logical structure, handles objections, avoids handwaving (appropriate to doc type)\n- Conceptual Clarity (0–5): definitions, distinctions, precision\n- Evidence/Support (0–5): citations, examples, credible grounding (appropriate to doc type)\n- Coherence/Structure (0–5): organized progression, not meandering\n\nB) ROI Score (0–10), sum of:\n- Time-to-value (0–4): How quickly it delivers high-density insight vs setup/fluff.\n- Transferability (0–3): How reusable the ideas/models are across contexts (not just this case/topic).\n- Marginal insight beyond basics (0–3): How much it goes beyond fundamentals into non-obvious distinctions, arguments, or synthesis (without assuming the reader is a beginner).\n\n## Step 5 — “Reference Handling” Rule (fixes the deferral problem)\nReferences/citations are scored as:\n- POSITIVE if they are integrated (author explains why they matter or uses them in an argument).\n- NEGATIVE only if the text mostly says “go read X” without adding interpretation or synthesis.\n\n## Step 6 — Final Tier (based on IVs + Intrinsic + ROI)\nFirst compute:\nTotal Value = (Sum of IV Scores) + Intrinsic Quality (0–20) + ROI (0–10).\n\nApply this gate:\n- If Intrinsic Quality < 8, cap at C (even if it feels exciting).\n\nTier mapping (use best judgment with these anchors):\n- S Tier: Total Value ≥ 40 AND no caps triggered.\n- A Tier: 30–39 AND no caps triggered.\n- B Tier: 20–29.\n- C Tier: 10–19 (or capped to C).\n- D Tier: <10.\n\n## Output format (strict)\n\nIMPORTANT: use the following exact JSON structure as given between ``` and ```. Don't add anything else to your response. Strictly follow this JSON structure. Only output the JSON structure itself, do not output the surrounding ``` marks.\n\n```\n{\n  \"TIER\": \"[S/A/B/C/D]\",\n  \"Doc Type\": \"[A–F]\",\n  \"Intrinsic Quality\": \"X/20\",\n  \"ROI\": \"R/10\",\n  \"IV Count\": \"N\",\n  \"Sum IV Score\": \"Z\",\n  \"Top Instances of Value (up to 7)\": [\n    {\n      \"IV summary\": \"[IV summary]\",\n      \"Depth\": \"[0–3]\",\n      \"Endurance\": \"[+0/+1]\",\n      \"IV Score\": \"[0–4]\"\n    }\n    // ... up to 7 such objects total\n  ],\n  \"Why this tier\": \"(2 sentences max)\",\n  \"Verdict\": \"Read / Skim / Skip (1 line)\",\n  \"What to read instead (optional)\": \"If skipping, name what kind of source would be higher ROI (e.g., \\\"a commentary\\\", \\\"a survey\\\", \\\"the primary paper\\\").\"\n}\n```",
