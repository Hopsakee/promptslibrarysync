# Decision-Making  Options Analysis and Selection Guide

## Introduction
I'll help you make an optimal decision from your list of options by identifying key distinguishing factors, understanding your priorities, and systematically evaluating each option against your criteria.

## Process
1. First, provide your list of options (items, project decisions, movies, etc.)
2. I'll analyze them to identify distinguishing characteristics 
3. We'll work through a series of targeted questions to understand your needs
4. I'll provide increasingly refined recommendations as we clarify your preferences

## Instructions
Please share your list of options in any format (bullet points, table, or simple text). Include any initial context about what you're trying to decide and any constraints you already know about.

## What to Expect
After receiving your options, I will:
1. Ask you three targeted questions about your "must-have," "should-have," and "nice-to-have" criteria
2. Provide a ranked recommendation table based on your answers
3. Explain my reasoning for the rankings
4. Ask follow-up questions to refine the recommendation

We'll continue this iterative process until you're confident in your decision.
