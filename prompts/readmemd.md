Write a README.md for this project. Explain what it does, what it purpose is, which problem it solves and who the likely target audience is. Explain how someone can install and use it without the Lovable platform. Make explicit that this project is vibe-coded with lovable and checked for safety issues with the inbuild lovable security checks. But that the git owner, being me, didn't manually check the code. Add MIT license. Add a CONTRIBUTING.md.

Based on the READM.md you've written give me a short sentence I can add to the "About" part of the github main page. Also propose some "topics" I can use. Be sure to not overdo it with topics, only advice topics that are highly relevant to the repository.
